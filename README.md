# ðŸ¥‡ Winner solution on the MIPI 2022 Challenge on Under-display Camera Image Restoration

Our team (USTC_WXYZ) wins the [MIPI 2022 Challenge on Under-display Camera Image Restoration](https://mipi-challenge.org/)!

## Dependencies

- Python
- Pytorch (1.8+)
- Numpy

## Testing on the Challendge Dataset
1. Prepare the testing data:  put the testing data into './test_data' folder.

2. To test our model , run the command:   "python testing.py"

3. Then, the processed results will be saved in './results' folder.

**Note that the pre-trained model has been saved in './ckpt' folder. And the pre-trained model is trained on the datasets privided by the challenge.
